## 🎯 What is Yagan?

**Yagan** is a revolutionary mobile application designed to transform the Swiss public rail experience. Through community-driven reporting and intelligent features, Yagan empowers travelers to make informed decisions, save money, and contribute to a better transportation ecosystem.

> 🚀 **Currently in active development** - Join us in building the future of Swiss rail travel!

## 💡 Why Yagan?

🏛️ **More than an app - it's a movement.** Yagan represents our commitment to accessible, sustainable public transportation in Switzerland. 

We believe that adequate government subsidies for Swiss Federal Railways (CFF) are essential for:
- 🌱 **Environmental sustainability** - Promoting green transportation alternatives
- 🤝 **Social equity** - Ensuring affordable access for all citizens  
- 🚊 **Public service** - Maintaining transportation as a public good, not just profit

In an era where climate action is critical, we stand for policies that prioritize community needs over corporate profits.
